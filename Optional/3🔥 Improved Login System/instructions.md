### Topic: Improved Login System Challenge

Let's take your login system skills to the next level! In this challenge, you‚Äôll build a more robust login system that not only checks if the username and password match, but also handles different scenarios like incorrect passwords or non-existent users. Are you ready to make sure only the right people can log in? üîê

## Scenario

You‚Äôre developing an improved login system that validates a user‚Äôs login credentials. The program will ask the user to input their username and password, then check the following:

1. **User Not Found:** If the username doesn‚Äôt match any stored usernames, the program should notify the user that they are not found.
2. **Password Incorrect:** If the username is found but the password doesn‚Äôt match, the program should inform the user that the password is incorrect.
3. **Login Successful:** If both the username and password match, the program should log the user in with a success message.

### Example Inputs and Outputs:

```js
// == Example 1 ==
// Input: Username: 'user123', Password: 'wrongpass'
// Output: "Incorrect password. Please try again."

// == Example 2 ==
// Input: Username: 'unknownUser', Password: 'pass456'
// Output: "User not found. Please sign up."

// == Example 3 ==
// Input: Username: 'user123', Password: 'pass456'
// Output: "Login successful! Welcome back."
```
