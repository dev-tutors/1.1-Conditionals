### Topic: Shopping Cart Total Challenge

Time to step into the shoes of an experienced shopper! In this challenge, youâ€™ll create a program that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart and applies a discount if the total exceeds a certain amount. Ready to check out? ðŸ’µðŸ›’

## Scenario

Youâ€™re building a simple shopping cart calculator. The user will input the prices of three items. The program will add these prices together to calculate the total. If the total exceeds $100, a 10% discount will be applied. The program should then display the final amount after any discount.

### Example Inputs and Outputs:

```javascript
// == Example 1 ==
// Input: Prices: 40, 50, 20
// Output: Total: 110, Discounted Total: 99

// == Example 2 ==
// Input: Prices: 25, 30, 40
// Output: Total: 95, Discounted Total: 95
```
